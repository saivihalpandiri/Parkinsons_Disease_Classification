# Parkinsons_Disease_Classification
Overview:

This project focuses on the classification of Parkinson's disease (PD) using machine learning techniques applied to a dataset of vocal features. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor function, and early detection is crucial for effective management. By leveraging data-driven approaches, this project aims to build and evaluate models that can accurately distinguish between individuals with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains vocal features extracted from audio recordings of patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy individuals. The dataset includes features and a target variable status, where:

'1' indicates the presence of Parkinson's disease. '0' indicates a healthy control.

Some important Features:

MDVP (Hz): Average vocal fundamental frequency MDVP (%), MDVP (Abs): Measures of variation in fundamental frequency MDVP , MDVP , Jitter : Various jitter measurements MDVP , Shimmer : Measures of variation in amplitude NHR, HNR: Noise-to-harmonics and harmonics-to-noise ratios RPDE, DFA: Signal fractal scaling exponent and signal smoothness spread1, spread2: Two nonlinear measures of the fundamental frequency variation D2: Another nonlinear measure PPE: A measure of vocal pressure
